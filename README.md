# Traffic Speed Prediction with Stacked LSTM
This project utilizes stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, including both unidirectional and bidirectional layers, to predict traffic speed.

# Overview
Traffic speed prediction is crucial for efficient traffic management and route optimization. This project employs advanced deep learning techniques to forecast traffic speeds accurately.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains traffic speed data collected over time. It includes information on traffic speed at different timestamps and locations.

**Note**: Due to privacy reasons, the dataset cannot be included directly in this repository. You can access the dataset via the following link: [Traffic Speed Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-rRwIPFDZcTWc7zZDcyd4XbIgecW97q)

# How it Works
**Data Preparation**: Ensure your traffic speed data is properly formatted for sequence prediction tasks.
**Model Architecture**: Construct a neural network with multiple LSTM layers, alternating between unidirectional and bidirectional layers.
**Training**: Split your dataset into training and validation sets, compile the model, and train it on the training data.
**Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize actual vs. predicted values.
# Usage
**Data Preparation**: Download the dataset from the provided link and prepare your traffic speed data in a suitable format.
**Model Configuration**: Configure the model architecture and hyperparameters based on your data and requirements.
**Training**: Train the model using your prepared data.
**Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the predictions.
